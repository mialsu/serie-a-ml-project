# serie-a-ml-project

## Introduction

This project is about utilizing machine learning to predict scores and total goal numbers in football matches with Python.
The data used is available free in [football-data.co.uk](https://www.football-data.co.uk/).

## Data preprocessing

First step is to preprocess the data so that it could be comsumed by various ML algorithms. From the original dataset, 
columns used are listed below:
- Date
- HomeTeam
- AwayTeam
- HS as *total shots taken by home team*
- AS as *total shots taken by away team*
- HST as *total shots on target by home team*
- AST as *total shots on target by away team*
- HC as *corner kicks won by home team*
- AC as *corner kicks won by away team*
- FTHG as *full time goals for home team*
- FTAG as *full time goals for away team*
- FTR as *full time result of match*
